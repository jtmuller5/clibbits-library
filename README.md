This repo contains a collection of docs I frequently copy and paste into Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. 

## My Setup
Each top-level directory corresponds to a Claude project that I copy my entire repo into. The markdown files in each directory can be copied individually or together using the [Clibbits VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeontheRocks.clibbits) (just select the files you want to copy, right click, and select "Copy for AI").

## Directories
- Firebase: Docs related to Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Firebase Authentication.
- Web: Documentation for an opinionated web stack, including React, React Router, React Query, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, and HeadlessUI.

## Usage
1. Install the Clibbits VS Code extension.
2. Select all of the directories and files you want to copy.
3. Right click and select "Copy for AI".
4. Paste into your AI of choice.

My preferred way of using this library is to create a handful of Claude projects where each one focuses on a specific tech stack. I paste all of the relevant files into the Project Knowledge section of the project as "Docs". Then, when I am working on a specific app, I copy the entire code base into the project knowledge section. Each of my Claude projects therefore serves as a plug-and-play knowledge base for a specific tech stack.

The risk, of course, is that there won't be enough space for larger code bases in the project knowledge section. In those cases, I recommend only copying the relevant files into the project knowledge section. Many times, this is completely fine.
