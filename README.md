This repo contains a collection of docs I frequently copy and paste into Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. 

## My Setup
Each top-level directory corresponds to a Claude project that I copy my entire repo into. The markdown files in each directory can be copied individually or together using the [Clibbits VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeontheRocks.clibbits) (just select the files you want to copy, right click, and select "Copy for AI").
